What are MyISAM and InnoDB
----------------------------------------
MyISAM and InnoDB are MySQL storage engines. Storage engines are database management system components used to manipulate data from in database.
MyISAM

MyISAM stands for Indexed Sequential Access Method. It was the default storage engine for MySQL until December 2009. With the release of MySQL 5.5, MyISAM was replaced with InnoDB.

MyISAM is based on an ISAM algorithm that displays information from large data sets fast. It has a small data footprint and is best suitable for data warehousing and web applications.


InnoDB

--------------------------------

InnoDB has been the default storage engine for MySQL since the release of MySQL 5.5. It is best suited for large databases that hold relational data.

InnoDB focuses on high reliability and performance, making it great for content management systems. One of the most known uses of InnoDB is MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia.



-----------------------------


The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).
-----------------------------------------------------

The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
